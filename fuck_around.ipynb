We had a walk-in closet of the size where you could have put a small bed in there; it served us nicely for the seven day stay. The decor was very refined, and oh the bathroom! Carrera marble floor was heated throughout, rain shower was to die for! | Location, as it turned out, was as good as it can be. We were 5 minutes walk to Trafalgar Square, but it was very quiet. Right outside was Embankment tube stop. We would walk to theater area and to numerous restaurants, and many major sites, such as London Eye or Westminster Abbey were within walking distance. | We had buffet breakfast or room service every morning. It was pricy, but my rate included it. Couple of nights, we had glass of wine sitting in front of fire place in the lobby. I used the spa, which is included in the room rate, almost every night. After a windchill day of sightseeing, the steam sauna and jacuzzi would soften my weary muscles. | I have stayed in many 5 star hotels around the world, but this hotel tops it.

I was made to pay my bill in full. | Upon my return to London I met up with a manager at the hotel Jean Louis.

He made it all so special with champagne,which was waiting for us in the room. To Jean Louis Fresta -Front of House Manager to Julius Asst front desk supervisor. We had a slight problem with the first room heated floors(which seem to be standard in all rooms) not working.(Oh yes the hotel has free yes free wifi and it worked in our room along with the one we switched to! )They tried to fix the problem but were unable to with out major work in house.They were very courteous as they wont enter your room if you have DND light on or are not there and have not spoken to you to enter. If you read the review you will see I am trying to point out what others seem to find fault with where we DID NOT. | Also the closet was huge in this standard room. Not be able to fix this they offered to move us from room #726 deluxe to room #321 which was a beautiful suite. | The room was excellently appointed in decoration. There are 2 rooms a small hallway and 1 full bathroom along with a entry hallway with a guest bath as we did entertain while there we did biz and pleasure. I loved the room with its accessories books to read Chanel and more all for the guests enjoyment. I must mention I loved the makeup table with mirror drawers so chic! | I also want to say we didnt even need to leave the hotel if we chose not to. | The brkfst was lawesome, so many choices to choose from.Breads eggs sausage bacon ceral fresh fruit yogart I think you get it. You could also see a menu if you didnt want the continental Breakfast. This served breakfast and lunch tea can be had in the wonderful hotel lobby which really isnt a hotel lobby like we think of in the states. Dinner can be had at Massimos yumme yumme italian and a French Restaruant which we did not eat there. The spa which was phenomenal along with a work out room,lots of water and use of certain spa amenities. | WOW OH WOW Thank You to Renaud Gregoire who I also had the pleasure to meet. He enables his staff to take care of the situation-get it handled make the customer happy! | I am sure if you are reading this you can see how much we loved this hotel. I hope you read this in its entirety,Yes I do go on and on...When a hotel deserves this recognition it should be lengthy. | We have stayed all over in mostly 6+ star/Diamond etc Hotels from California to Hawaii to Rome Cavalieri Hotel. This is the Jewel of all! | Once you read this review please contact me if you have any questions. | We loved it so much we are going back in November --yes just 2 short months later.. | I just didnt want to leave ever. | When we first arrived our stay was originally for 3 days, we extended our stay from 3 days to 4 more for a total of 7days---still not long enough! | Please realize you are in Europe and if you are from the states things/matters do run a little differently here.There is a hierarchy so know they do want to help you but must get the all ok from higher....Please treat the hotel and staff with courtesy (No I don't work here or for any hotel affiliation with them or any Hotel for that matter) .If there is a blip with your reservation or room just be patient. | There are so many people from the Hotel to say \"Thank You\" to. I hope you will show this to your staff Mr Dixion. | Thank You to you and all your staff for making our trip to LONDON so unbelievable we already have reservations for November 18th to 24th-confirmed! | Sincerely | With Warm Regards | Natalya Lisa</td>\n",

       "      <td>I stayed at the Savoy March 2-5 and had a lovely stay. The hotel is steeped in history(pics of celeb guests of yesteryear, Kaspar the 14th guest cat who rounds up unlucky dinner parties of 13, lovely art and antique elevators), amazing bars and lounges....I highly recommend a visit to the American Bar, and the best tea in London. Sadly my husband fell ill while visitng but the Savoy called a doctor and arranged for an in room visit. Luckily he felt better quickly and we were able to take advantage of all the fantastic amenities, the perfect location and fantastic service of this very special place. Ironically ten years prior to our stay when we were in a much different financial bracket we had tea at the Savoy with dreams of staying one day....it lived up to every expectaion! Cheers!</td>\n",

They had taken note that it was a special day for us and that was how they made us feel, a bottle of wine was sent to our very modern room that had a view of the Thames and the city as we were on the 15th floor with a message of congratulations. We were so impressed with the hotel and staff that we changed our plans for our evening meal and chose to try the restaurant on the ground floor and was not disappointed with the lovely meal and once again the fantastic staff. we eventually left the hotel to spend time in London</td>\n",

This hotel was perfect in every way. Communication with the hotel before staying was prompt, and very efficient. Checking in was a breeze. You go through the spectacular lobby with modern glass chandeliers and take the elevator to your room. My room, they gave me an upgrade to junior suite, was spectacular. We had a walk-in closet of the size where you could have put a small bed in there; it served us nicely for the seven day stay. The decor was very refined, and oh the bathroom! Carrera marble floor was heated throughout, rain shower was to die for! | Location, as it turned out, was as good as it can be. We were 5 minutes walk to Trafalgar Square, but it was very quiet. Right outside was Embankment tube stop. We would walk to theater area and to numerous restaurants, and many major sites, such as London Eye or Westminster Abbey were within walking distance. | We had buffet breakfast or room service every morning. It was pricy, but my rate included it. Couple of nights, we had glass of wine sitting in front of fire place in the lobby. I used the spa, which is included in the room rate, almost every night. After a windchill day of sightseeing, the steam sauna and jacuzzi would soften my weary muscles. | I have stayed in many 5 star hotels around the world, but this hotel tops it. I would return here in a heartbeat next time I am in London.   \n",

lovely first visit to this iconic hotel bar! | Wonderful service, without being intrusive at all! Very delicious cocktails and just generally all round, a very indulgent experience. | Well worth visiting only for that 'once in a lifetime' experience, though do make sure you are feeling 'flush' it doesn't come cheap!   \n",

Heathrow. We like the location clost to the partk and in walking distance of most locations. The room and bath were small compared to American Hotels but very clean. We enjoyed the free WIFI. The owners and the staff were very friendly and helpful with taxi's and resturant recomendations. We would stay there again.   \n",

So I heard about the corinthia via some friends who work in the industry and said their bar was really something. Until the incident I had stay there a total of 3 times but on the 4th time in June I was on my second of 4 nights and was about get some cash from my room as I was going to exchange money for some dollars as I was flying to the US pretty soon. When I came to my money it felt light. When I counted it, it was almost £1000 down. Obviously shocked I contacted reception. They started an investigation! | Well a couple of days later I had to checkout and the matter was not resolved. I was made to pay my bill in full. | Upon my return to London I met up with a manager at the hotel Jean Louis. He said the matter was still under investigation and he gave me his card to get in touch. Nothing was ever resolved. | This hotel does not only boast to be one of the best hotels in London but one of the best in the world. You pay premium for this reason and you expect a premium service. This hotel epically failed me and dented my confidence in the hotel industry. I didn't even get a formal apology. | It's a lovely hotel but I would have to say stay at your own risk but for over £500 a night should there be any risk?   \n",

I booked a double room for around 59 pounds on a Friday night. Good value for money as a continental breakfast was included too. The location is easily accessible from Paddington and Lancaster Gate stations although it's currently behind temporary fencing of Crossrail construction work. So one has to walk around either side of the fencing to get to number 195. Check in was quick, the staff helpful and friendly. I mistakenly booked 2 singles and asked to change to a double and was offered one in another building that is part of the hotel. Room was clean, warm with a lovely comfy bed. There was a shower with gel provided and a hair dryer too. Lots of clean and fresh towels. | A word of caution to any person with accessibility issues: the rooms are spread over 4 floors but there is no lifts and if you are accommodation is that the annexe, you have to go to the other building for breakfast. I didn't find these issues off putting at all due to the excellent location of this place with plenty of good restaurants and local shops around. Plus Hyde park is around the corner!   \n",
       "96  First I want to apologize to the hotel in my delay and slack in writing this review. Got Home and Life just happens..No excuses just WOW OH WOW..I wanted to give the Hotel and the review the time it deserves-They are more then 7 stars.They sure were not slack in there service,hospitality and open arms welcoming.(you will see I am kinda a dramatic gurl-LOL | This is a wonderful Hotel,the pictures do not ---I repeat ---do not do it even come close to doing the hotel justice! I am hoping my pictures will help with that-you be the judge! | The Hotels sheer designer opulence and attention to detail is remarkable. I also want to say I read all reviews before booking here. | Some were umm emmm well ---a little less complimentary-I dont know why. I hope you will all think twice and stay here over some where else! | The staff, I swear must have to answer a secret question only they know. For what I mean by this,is that they all are there to help you have AN UNBELIEVABLE STAY!!!! And I do mean unbelievable stay. | The whole staff and I do mean all the staff from Concierge,Front Desk greeters to the Door Man to the Porters(who I might say if you are from the states 1 of them looks just like a young version of Christian Slater was soo sweet ran down the street got taxis when it took to long or was raining,he took pics for us) The one Door man who is from Ireland gave us suggestions where to go as this was our 2nd leg of the trip. We were going to the Notre Dame Game there.To the cleaning staff,as I smoke(oh there is no smoking in the rooms or in hotel)however there is a lovely courtyard that is built between the hotel walls that you may smoke a cig or cigar. Lovely fireplaces at each end and you may also order sandwiches or tea. To the restaurant servers at Massimos the Head Receiptionist Oonagha,to Maxime the Asst Manager who waited on us. | Everyone and I do mean everyone from the Concierges with Darren, Justin and Sebastian, to the Front Desk Ben Milsom Reservations Supervisor. He helped with the car service(we chose a JaguarXJ cost of £140 from the service of\" Quintessentially\"(please ask for Mark07738971555) and the initial reservation. | Our room was unbelievable a deluxe room,a lovely chocolate confection cake to celebrate our 1st trip to london and more. He made it all so special with champagne,which was waiting for us in the room. To Jean Louis Fresta -Front of House Manager to Julius Asst front desk supervisor. We had a slight problem with the first room heated floors(which seem to be standard in all rooms) not working.(Oh yes the hotel has free yes free wifi and it worked in our room along with the one we switched to! )They tried to fix the problem but were unable to with out major work in house.They were very courteous as they wont enter your room if you have DND light on or are not there and have not spoken to you to enter. If you read the review you will see I am trying to point out what others seem to find fault with where we DID NOT. | Also the closet was huge in this standard room. Not be able to fix this they offered to move us from room #726 deluxe to room #321 which was a beautiful suite. | The room was excellently appointed in decoration. There are 2 rooms a small hallway and 1 full bathroom along with a entry hallway with a guest bath as we did entertain while there we did biz and pleasure. I loved the room with its accessories books to read Chanel and more all for the guests enjoyment. I must mention I loved the makeup table with mirror drawers so chic! | I also want to say we didnt even need to leave the hotel if we chose not to. | The brkfst was lawesome, so many choices to choose from.Breads eggs sausage bacon ceral fresh fruit yogart I think you get it. You could also see a menu if you didnt want the continental Breakfast. This served breakfast and lunch tea can be had in the wonderful hotel lobby which really isnt a hotel lobby like we think of in the states. Dinner can be had at Massimos yumme yumme italian and a French Restaruant which we did not eat there. The spa which was phenomenal along with a work out room,lots of water and use of certain spa amenities. | WOW OH WOW Thank You to Renaud Gregoire who I also had the pleasure to meet. He enables his staff to take care of the situation-get it handled make the customer happy! | I am sure if you are reading this you can see how much we loved this hotel. I hope you read this in its entirety,Yes I do go on and on...When a hotel deserves this recognition it should be lengthy. | We have stayed all over in mostly 6+ star/Diamond etc Hotels from California to Hawaii to Rome Cavalieri Hotel. This is the Jewel of all! | Once you read this review please contact me if you have any questions. | We loved it so much we are going back in November --yes just 2 short months later.. | I just didnt want to leave ever. | When we first arrived our stay was originally for 3 days, we extended our stay from 3 days to 4 more for a total of 7days---still not long enough! | Please realize you are in Europe and if you are from the states things/matters do run a little differently here.There is a hierarchy so know they do want to help you but must get the all ok from higher....Please treat the hotel and staff with courtesy (No I don't work here or for any hotel affiliation with them or any Hotel for that matter) .If there is a blip with your reservation or room just be patient. | There are so many people from the Hotel to say \"Thank You\" to. I hope you will show this to your staff Mr Dixion. | Thank You to you and all your staff for making our trip to LONDON so unbelievable we already have reservations for November 18th to 24th-confirmed! | Sincerely | With Warm Regards | Natalya Lisa   \n",

The hotel is steeped in history(pics of celeb guests of yesteryear, Kaspar the 14th guest cat who rounds up unlucky dinner parties of 13, lovely art and antique elevators), amazing bars and lounges....I highly recommend a visit to the American Bar, and the best tea in London. Sadly my husband fell ill while visitng but the Savoy called a doctor and arranged for an in room visit. Luckily he felt better quickly and we were able to take advantage of all the fantastic amenities, the perfect location and fantastic service of this very special place. Ironically ten years prior to our stay when we were in a much different financial bracket we had tea at the Savoy with dreams of staying one day....it lived up to every expectaion! Cheers!   \n",

day celebration of my 50th birthday and we were so pleased that it was the Mondrian that we chose for my big day, from the minute we checked in the staff were friendly, trendy and very polite. They had taken note that it was a special day for us and that was how they made us feel, a bottle of wine was sent to our very modern room that had a view of the Thames and the city as we were on the 15th floor with a message of congratulations. We were so impressed with the hotel and staff that we changed our plans for our evening meal and chose to try the restaurant on the ground floor and was not disappointed with the lovely meal and once again the fantastic staff. we eventually left the hotel to spend time in London   \n",
